### CPSC 120

* Lab 2 

    Lab 2, part 2 was a favorite of mine because I love to play madlibs
    when I was younger. I was able to create my own and write atd functions
    that relased an output and, when prompted, collect the input to be used
    at the end. The final output was a collection of the inputs collected
    from the earlier questions asked. 

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was another I enjoyed because we focued back to the madlibs
    for a second time. In this lab, a different method of coding was used.
    Instead of a larger amount of outpus and inputs, this lab had us use
    vector lists to hold the inputs collected and then recalled them for our 
    final output statement.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was interesting because we were verifying the provided
    schedules, and I love to be organized. In the lab, we used boolean functions
    and "if" statements to verify and compare the collectec schedules.
    The program asked for 2 schedules to be provided and both were verified
    for approval or denied.
